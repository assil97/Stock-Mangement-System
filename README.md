# Stock-Mangement-System
### Project created and documented by Syed Shakeeb 
 
This is my first Mini Project for the college which is based on Stock Management System using Java AWT. 

It does two operations in the program which are:

    1. Add the item when new item is inserted which further make a count of the item available in the stock.
    2. Deleting the item from the stock management when not required.

Please read the documentation in the given .pdf file for Documentation and flowchart of the program.
